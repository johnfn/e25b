        <h2>E25B Game</h2>

<p>Hi! This is the writeup for my E25B game. </p>

<h2>What I wanted to accomplish</h2>

<p>The overarching goal for my game was going to be to teach the basic concepts of Bioengineering to people who were new to BioE. Of course, I recognized at the time that teaching all of BioE was going to be way too huge of a topic to cover given the amount of time that I had to work on the final project, so I decided to focus on a smaller topics: Genetic engineering and plasmids. Particularly, I thought it would be pretty neat if people could learn how genetic engineering worked by playing a game. </p>

<p>When I was listening to the topics in class, I found myself thinking of it kind of in terms of games, since it just seemed to make more sense that way. I figured that maybe other people would be able to understand the topics better in a similar presentation to what I imagined. I thought it would be really cool if people could physically see the creation of plasmids on their screen, and see what could successfully create a plasmid (or vector) and how they could be used. Players could also use the game to be introduced to Bio terminology (as there is a lot of it).</p>

<h2>What I got done</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the amount of work that I set out for myself turned out to be a lot more than I had anticipated. What this meant is that although I was able to program most of the basic game mechanics, I unfortunately fell short of time when it came to adding features. I put a <em>lot</em> of work into the game - nearly an entire week of work without other commitments! The game is at a point now where it would be very easy to extend and add new features and things to learn, but it's currently more like a platform than a finished product.</p>

<p>One neat thing that I got done is the inventory system. You can pick up items in the game, and on the right side you can see a list of all the items you've picked up. If you click on any of these items, the game will explain to you what the items are. This is a nice way for players to learn new BioE vocabulary without having it feel forced or unnatural - every item should (in theory) have a purpose in the game.</p>

<p>Another cool thing that I did get done was basic genetic engineering! You can find the basic things you need to bioengineer on the ground. If you drag these into the plasmid in your inventory (on the right side of the screen) and click build, then you'll have created a neat new molecule/weapon for yourself! You can then hold down x to shoot this at the monster (the moving black square). </p>
